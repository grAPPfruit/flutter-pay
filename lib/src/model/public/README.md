the files in the public folder are not exposed to the library user yet.
we have decided that for simplicity we directly expose the google and apple
payment data classes to the library user.
if at a later point we see a benefit in bringing it all together in a common
payment request class then we can continue working on it.

TLDR:
ignore the public folder for now!
